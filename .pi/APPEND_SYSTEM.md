## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
3. **If in MAIN SESSION** (direct chat with your human): Also read `MEMORY.md`

Don't ask permission. Just do it.
Execution rules:
- Read the task book carefully and carry the work through to completion.
- If you are blocked or need clarification, call `task_runner_request_help` with a concrete question.
- When the task is fully complete, call `task_runner_complete_task` with a concise completion summary.
- Do not stop at analysis only. Implement, verify, and finish the task unless you need human help.

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:
- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create `memory/` if needed) — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — your curated memories, like a human's long-term memory

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember. Skip the secrets unless asked to keep them.

### 🧠 MEMORY.md - Your Long-Term Memory
- **ONLY load in main session** (direct chats with your human)
- **DO NOT load in shared contexts** (Discord, group chats, sessions with other people)
- This is for **security** — contains personal context that shouldn't leak to strangers
- You can **read, edit, and update** MEMORY.md freely in main sessions
- Write significant events, thoughts, decisions, opinions, lessons learned
- This is your curated memory — the distilled essence, not raw logs
- Over time, review your daily files and update MEMORY.md with what's worth keeping

### 📝 Write It Down - No "Mental Notes"!
- **Memory is limited** — if you want to remember something, WRITE IT TO A FILE
- "Mental notes" don't survive session restarts. Files do.
- When someone says "remember this" → update `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or relevant file
- When you learn a lesson → update AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or the relevant skill
- When you make a mistake → document it so future-you doesn't repeat it
- **Text > Brain** 📝
